           ******-----------------------------------------------------------******
 1.1 Basic server and clients using sockets
   - compile both client.c and server.c from two different terminal
     -- gcc server.c -o server (in Server directory)
     -- gcc client.c -o client (in Client directory)
					(or)
     -- gcc server.c followed by ./a.out
     -- gcc client.c followed by ./a.out
   - first run the server in Server directory by using ./server
   - now go to client directory from another terminal run the client by using ./client
   - now give input file name in space provided by client to download the files using socket

 1.2 Persistent and Non-persistent connections
   - We have used python for this part
   - persistent is better than non-persistent connection is the conclusion obtained
   - install pathlib using pip

 	Persistent:
	1. go to server_persistent  file containing directory and run python server_persistent 
	2. go to client_persistent  file containing directory in another terminal and run python client_persistent <filenames 			seperated by space>
	3. Here we are transfering multiple files using same socket.
	4. files will download into client directory

	Non-persistent:
	1. go to server_nonpersistent  file containing directory and run python server_nonpersistent 
	2. go to client_nonpersistent  file containing directory in another terminal and run python client_nonpersistent <filenames  seperated by space>
	3. Here we are transfering multiple files by creating different sockets.
	4. files will download into client directory

### By using times we got to know that persistent is faster than non persistent
